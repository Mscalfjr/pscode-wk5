// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number is a multiple of 2 it is even	
print number 

else it is odd 
print number

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)1 2 3 4 5 

b)num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 
divide to get average

c)compare to see which number is smallest of all listed 
 if number is > 5,4,3,2, it is the smallest 
else number is <1,2,3,4 it is the largest 
d) 1 will be the smallest and 5 will be the largest
